# Backorder-project

Backorder means order for any good or service which cannot be fulfilled due to lack of resources such as raw materials,production capactity.Total backorders, also known as backlog, may be expressed in terms of units or dollar amount.A backorder can be both a good thing and a bad thing.Consider a company like Apple that recently rolled out several new iphone models.Because the initial supply cannot keep up with the magnitude of demand, Apple is immediately in a backorder situation.

On a positive note,backorders indicate a healthy demand for the product.In the case of Apple,customers are likely to wait for several months to get the latest apple products but apple's competitors doesn't have this luxury.Customers will cancel their orders and go somewhere else. Machine learning can identify patterns related to backorders before customer orders.



DATA _The data comes from dataset: Kaggle’s Can You Predict Product Backorders? _ The data file contains the historical data for the 8 weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict. The data were taken as weekly snapshots at the start of each week. The target (or response) is the went_on_backorder variable. To model and predict the target, we’ll use the other features, which include:

* sku – Random ID for the product
* national_inv – Current inventory level for the part
* lead_time – Transit time for product (if available)
* in_transit_qty – Amount of product in transit from source
* forecast_3_month – Forecast sales for the next 3 months
* forecast_6_month – Forecast sales for the next 6 months
* forecast_9_month – Forecast sales for the next 9 months
* sales_1_month – Sales quantity for the prior 1 month time period
* sales_3_month – Sales quantity for the prior 3 month time period
* sales_6_month – Sales quantity for the prior 6 month time period
* sales_9_month – Sales quantity for the prior 9 month time period
* min_bank – Minimum recommend amount to stock
* potential_issue – Source issue for part identified
* pieces_past_due – Parts overdue from source
* perf_6_month_avg – Source performance for prior 6 month period
* perf_12_month_avg – Source performance for prior 12 month period
* local_bo_qty – Amount of stock orders overdue
* deck_risk – Part risk flag
* oe_constraint – Part risk flag
* ppap_risk – Part risk flag
* stop_auto_buy – Part risk flag
* rev_stop – Part risk flag
* went_on_backorder – Product actually went on backorder. This is the target value.



Data Preprocessing
* Data is imbalanced.
* Imputed missing values using median in the columns lead time and source performance.
* Categorical binary attributes have been converted to numerical attributes(Yes/No to 1/0).
* Drop unused levels(current inventory level has negative values,this may be due to some errors).
* Checked for correlation and some columns are correlated with each other.


Statistical tests
* Two-sample t-test was applied to check whether the avg lead_time of products not resulting in backorders is equal to avg lead_time of products resulting in backorders.
* Two-sample t-test was applied to check whether the avg current inventory level of products not resulting in backorders is equal to avg current inventory level of products resulting in backorders.


Challenges and risks
* The challenge is with this problem is that the data is imbalanced,when the majority class significantly outweighs the minorty class(class we are interestd in,that's positive class). To deal with this class imbalance, SMOTE(synthetic minority over-sampling technique) was used which oversamples the minority class by generating synthetic minority examples in the neighborhood of observed ones.
* The second challenge is optimizing for the business case. To do so, we could explore cutoff (threshold) optimization which can be used to find the cutoff that maximizes expected profit.


Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning.
* Decision tree was used to build the model and achieved a base accuracy score of 92% with a f1 score of 0.92 for negative class and f1 score of 0.93 for positive class.
* After Hyperparameter Tuning,the base accuracy score has improved to 94% with a f1 score of 0.95 for both the positive and negative classes.


Metrics:
* `True Positivies(TP)` : Model correctly predicted that the product will go backorder and the customer needs this now.The benefit is profit.

* `True Negative (TN)` : Model correctly predicted that the product will not go backorder and the benefit is zero because
  the customer doesn't buy the product.
  
* `False Positivies(FP)` : Model incorrectly predicted that the product will go backorder,this is classifying a product as backordered when the demand is not present and it will increase the warehousing and inventory related cost

* `False Negative (FN)` : Model incorrectly predicted that the product will not go backorder when the demand is present.This will lead to customer loss.


ROC Curve The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical method that measures the true positive rate (y-axis) against the false positive rate (x-axis). The benefit to the ROC curve:

* We can visualize how the binary classification model compares to randomly guessing
* We can calculate AUC (Area Under the Curve), which is a method to compare models (perfect classification = 1). We could use the ROC curve and pick a threshold for classification that corresponds to the point on the line for our desired balance between the true positive rate and false positive rate.
