# Backorder-project

Backorder means order for any good or service which cannot be fulfilled due to lack of resources such as raw materials,production capactity.Total backorders, also known as backlog, may be expressed in terms of units or dollar amount.A backorder can be both a good thing and a bad thing.Consider a company like Apple that recently rolled out several new iphone models.Because the initial supply cannot keep up with the magnitude of demand, Apple is immediately in a backorder situation.

On a positive note,backorders indicate a healthy demand for the product.In the case of Apple,customers are likely to wait for several months to get the latest apple products but apple's competitors doesn't have this luxury.Customers will cancel their orders and go somewhere else. Machine learning can identify patterns related to backorders before customer orders.

DATA _The data comes from dataset: Kaggle’s Can You Predict Product Backorders? _ The data file contains the historical data for the 8 weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict. The data were taken as weekly snapshots at the start of each week. The target (or response) is the went_on_backorder variable. To model and predict the target, we’ll use the other features, which include:

sku – Random ID for the product
national_inv – Current inventory level for the part
lead_time – Transit time for product (if available)
in_transit_qty – Amount of product in transit from source
forecast_3_month – Forecast sales for the next 3 months
forecast_6_month – Forecast sales for the next 6 months
forecast_9_month – Forecast sales for the next 9 months
sales_1_month – Sales quantity for the prior 1 month time period
sales_3_month – Sales quantity for the prior 3 month time period
sales_6_month – Sales quantity for the prior 6 month time period
sales_9_month – Sales quantity for the prior 9 month time period
min_bank – Minimum recommend amount to stock
potential_issue – Source issue for part identified
pieces_past_due – Parts overdue from source
perf_6_month_avg – Source performance for prior 6 month period
perf_12_month_avg – Source performance for prior 12 month period
local_bo_qty – Amount of stock orders overdue
deck_risk – Part risk flag
oe_constraint – Part risk flag
ppap_risk – Part risk flag
stop_auto_buy – Part risk flag
rev_stop – Part risk flag
went_on_backorder – Product actually went on backorder. This is the target value.
